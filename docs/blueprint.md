## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Aqua (#7FFFD4), inspired by the B&B's existing turquoise accents, evokes a light, airy, sunny atmosphere.
- Background color: Off-white (#F5F5DC) provides a clean, bright, and welcoming feel.
- Accent color: Light Tan (#F0E68C) for calls to action and interactive elements, giving warmth without overpowering the design.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) adds a fashionable and artsy touch, perfect for headlines and shorter content.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif), when more than a short paragraph of text needs to be displayed.
- Use simple, line-based icons in aqua to maintain a light and modern aesthetic.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout to showcase the B&Bâ€™s photos and information effectively.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as fade-ins for content or smooth transitions between pages.
